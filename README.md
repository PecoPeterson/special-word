# special-word
The rules of Hangman are as follows:

    One player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess the word.
    The player who thinks of the word gives the length of the word to the guessing player.
    The guessing player suggests letters or numbers, one at a time, within a certain number of guesses.
    If the suggested letter is in the word, the other player writes it in its correct position(s).
    If the suggested letter is not in the word, a part of a "hangman" stick figure is drawn.
    The game is over when the guessing player completes the word or when the stick figure is fully drawn, indicating that they have run out of guesses.
    The guessing player wins if they correctly guess the word before the stick figure is fully drawn.
    The player who thought of the word wins if the guessing player does not correctly guess the word before the stick figure is fully drawn.

The number of guesses allowed to the guessing player, the number of body parts shown on the stick figure, and the specific rules regarding guessing phrases, words with spaces, or special characters may vary depending on the version of the game being played.
